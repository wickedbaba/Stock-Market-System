# Stock-Market-System

I had school assignment, where we were asked to demonstrate our **Java** skills by making a **Stock market and Brokerage system**.
A pdf containing the problem statement was proved to us- <br>
Go through the pdf to understand more about how and what is happening.

There are 4 files that have been used to make the program -

1. **inputProject.class** - It contains all the methods which add, delete, or display the obejct and its values .


2. **orderBook.class** - It conatins a class called orderbook, which defines the parameters of an order book, namely -  
  > trader's name | buy or sell | scrip | quantity | rate.
  
  
3. **Trader.class** - It contains the trader class, which defines the parameters of a trader, namely -
  > id | funds | list of owned Stocks.
  
  
4. **Stock.class** - It contains the stock class, which defines the parameters of a stock, namely - 
  > ticker | sector | open | high | low | close | type of stock.
